# Password: A simple password manager

 Password for Mac OS X manages your logins securely, and portably, so no more Post-It notes or text files. 

 ## Simple Interface

 Firstly, password is simple. It only stores your passwords and notes/URLs about them. Notes are useful for things like account numbers, sign up dates, and details about orders or items purchased. URLs can be used to quickly access the site, where you can enter the login details. 

 ## Security

Your saved password files are 256-bit AES Encrypted. That means it's very secure. We use a master password to protect all of your real login details. If someone tries to open the file but doesn't have that password, they won't uncover a thing! (But, and this is kinda important, don't lose the master password. Even I can't recover that for you!) 

## Remote Access

Feel free to use some cloud storage if you have more than one Mac. Password has been tested with the following cloud storage platforms:

* Dropbox-friendly
* Google Drive-friendly
* Box-friendly

Also, feel free to use any portable storage devices, USB sticks or whatever you like. Of course, you want to keep it safe.

## Organize Your Logins

Save all your social networking passwords in one file, and your work logins, etc. in another. (Or, put them all together; that's cool too.) If you are a freelancer, create a separate file for each of your clients, and send them a copy of the file for safe keeping. If they like the idea, feel free to send them here to download Password as well :)

# FAQ

## Are you actively developing this app?

No. In fact, part of the reason I stopped development on it was that I lost the source (my Subversion server broke down and then I had a hard drive crash). Now I am finally putting the source up, so that I might work on it again, or maybe someone else might find it interesting.

## What versions of macOS does this app work with?

Last I checked, 10.11.x. I did a quick check and it builds in a recent version of xcode, but it definitely needs some care.

## What can I do with this code?

You can build the app! You can modify it as you see fit (so long as it fits within the MIT license).

## Do you have a changelog or something, showing how you got to this point?

The thing above about subversion... :( Apparently, [it's not possible](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2347174/can-i-retrieve-an-svn-log-from-a-local-copy).

## The site ... looks better than the app. What gives?

There is a reason for that :).
